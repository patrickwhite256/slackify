Slackify
========

You know how useful Slack statuses are, right? Use that space for something interesting, like showing what you're currently playing on Spotify.

There's currently just a proof of concept, but there's some stuff on the roadmap I'll get to soon (tm).

Requirements/Installation
-------------------------

TODO


TODO
----
- Run web server that allows users to register (possibly with "Sign in with Slack"
- Allow enabling/disabling and choosing of "playing" emoji
- Better state maintenance - record last emoji and status, and apply those when not listening.
